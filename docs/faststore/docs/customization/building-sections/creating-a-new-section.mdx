title: 'Creating a new section'
---

In this guide, you will learn how to create a new section for your storefront and make it available in the [Headless CMS](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/guides/faststore/headless-cms-overview). This solution is useful when your project requires a section not natively available in FastStore.

For this guide, we will create two sections:
- `Call to Action` Gets a specific action from the user.
- `OurStores`: Indicates the closest store for the user.

  > ℹ️ Sections are page components that wrap up other components, enabling you to create cohesive and functional content for your store. For example, the Hero section is a native section that includes the following components: `Hero`, `HeroImage`, and `HeroHeader`.

## Before you begin

<Steps>

### 1. Integrate the store with the Headless CMS

All sections must be available in the Headless CMS so they can be added and managed on your store's pages. To integrate your FastStore project, please refer to the [Headless CMS integration track](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/guides/faststore/headless-cms-1-configuring-the-vtex-account).

### 2. Knowledge of how sections and content types work on Headless CMS

During the creation of a new section, you will create files such as `sections.json` and `content-types.json`, which follow a structure established for the Headless CMS.

### 3. Install the FastStore CLI

Make sure to install the FastStore CLI to use its commands locally. Refer to the [FastStore CLI](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/guides/faststore/getting-started-3-faststore-cli) guide for more information.

</Steps>

## `Call to Action`

### Step 1: Creating folders and files related to the Headless CMS

1. In the FastStore root directory, create a folder named `cms`.
2. Inside `cms`, create the `faststore` folder.
3. Within the `cms/faststore` folder, create `sections.json` file.
4. In the `sections.json` file, add the new section that you want to display in the Headless CMS. The schema below defines how the Headless CMS renders a section:

  ```json sections.json
    [
      {
        "name": "CallToAction",
        "schema": {
          "title": "Call To Action",
          "description": "Get your 20% off on the first purchase!",
          "type": "object",
          "required": [
            "title",
            "link"
          ],
          "properties": {
            "title": {
              "title": "Title",
              "type": "string"
            },
            "link": {
              "title": "Link Path",
              "type": "object",
              "required": [
                "text",
                "url"
              ],
              "properties": {
                "text": {
                  "title": "Text",
                  "type": "string"
                },
                "url": {
                  "title": "URL",
                  "type": "string"
                }
              }
            }
          }
        }
      }
    ]
  ```

  > ℹ️ This new section receives a title and a link pointing to a specific location.

### Step 2: Creating the new section

To render the `CallToAction` section you created in the previous step, you need to create this section component.

1. If you don't already have it, create a folder named `components` inside the `src` directory.
2. Inside the `components` folder, create a file named `CallToAction.tsx` and add the following code:

  ```tsx src/components/CallToAction.tsx
  import React from "react";

  export interface CallToActionProps {
    title: string;
    link: {
      text: string;
      url: string;
    };
  }

  export default function CallToAction(props: CallToActionProps) {
    return (
      <section>
        <h2>{props.title}</h2>
        <a href={props.link.url}>{props.link.text}</a>
      </section>
    );
  }
  ```

This section will receive the `link` and `title` defined previously in the `sections.json` file.

3. Create a file named `index.tsx` inside the components folder.

  > ℹ️ The `index.tsx` file provides an entry point for importing and using the `CallToAction` component. It acts as a container for all the components within the components folder and allows for easier organization and reusability of code.

Open the `index.tsx` file and add the following code:

  ```tsx src/components/index.tsx
  import CallToAction from './CallToAction'

  export default { CallToAction }
  ```

### Step 3: Synchronizing the new section with the Headless CMS

1. In the terminal, run `faststore cms-sync`. This command will synchronize the new section you created with the CMS.
2. Go to the VTEX Admin and access **Storefront > Headless CMS**.
3. Click on the `Page` content type.

4. In the `Sections` tab, click the `+`, search for the new `Call to Action` section, and add it to your page.

## `OurStore`

1. After [creating the files and folders](#step-1-creating-folders-and-files-related-to-the-headless-cms), In the `sections.json` file, add the new section that you want to display in the Headless CMS. 
The schema below defines how the Headless CMS renders the `OurStores` section that we will use in the example:

  ```json sections.json
  [
    {
      "name": "OurStores",
      "schema": {
        "title": "Our Stores",
        "description": "Search stores near to the users",
        "type": "object",
        "required": ["title", "description"],
        "properties": {
          "title": {
            "title": "Title",
            "type": "string",
            "default": "Explore Nearby Stores"
          },
          "description": {
            "title": "Link Path",
            "type": "string",
            "default": "Discover the closest store to you and pay us a visit."
          }
        }
      }
    }
  ]
  ```

2.  Inside the `components` folder, create a file named `OurStores.tsx` and add the following code:

  ```tsx src/components/OurStores.tsx
  import React from 'react'
  import { Button, Icon, SelectField } from '@faststore/ui'

  export interface OurStoresProps {
    title: string
    description: string
  }

  export default function OurStores(props: OurStoresProps) {
    return (
      <section>
        <h2>{props.title}</h2>
        <p>{props.description}</p>
        <div>
          <SelectField
            id="select-state-store"
            label="State:"
            options={{
              newYork: 'New York',
              arizona: 'Arizona',
              massachusetts: 'Massachusetts',
              hawaii: 'Hawaii',
            }}
          />
          <SelectField
            id="select-city-store"
            label="City:"
            options={{
              newYorkCity: 'New York City',
              phoenix: 'Phoenix',
              boston: 'Boston',
              honolulu: 'Honolulu',
            }}
          />
          <Button
            variant="secondary"
            icon={<Icon name="ArrowRight" />}
            iconPosition="right"
          >
            Find Store
          </Button>
        </div>
      </section>
    )
  }
  ```

For this section, we will use the following components from the Faststore UI: [Button](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/guides/faststore/atoms-button), [Icon](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/guides/faststore/atoms-icon) and [SelectField](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/guides/faststore/molecules/select-field).

3. Create a file named `index.tsx` inside the components folder, and add the following code:

  ```tsx src/components/index.tsx
  import OurStores from './OurStores'

  export default { OurStores }
  ```

4. Repeat the steps in [Step 3: Synchronizing the new section with the Headless CMS](#step3-synchronizing-the-new-section-with-the-headless-cms), and you should see the new section but without styles as in the example below:
