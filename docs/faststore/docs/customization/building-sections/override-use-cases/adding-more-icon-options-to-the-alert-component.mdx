title: 'Adding more icon options to the Alert component'
---

This guide illustrates a common use case for [`getOverriddenSection`](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/guides/faststore/overrides-getoverriddensection-function) in FastStore. It focuses on customizing the Headless CMS schema for a section to provide more icon options.

> ℹ️ For detailed instructions on overriding components, refer to [Overriding native component’s props](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/guides/faststore/overrides-component-props) and [Overriding a native component](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/guides/faststore/overrides-native-component).

## Context

- The native [Alert](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/guides/faststore/building-sections-list-of-native-sections#alert ) section provides the following icon options by default:

    | Alert default icon name | Icon                |
    | ----------------------- | ------------------- |
    | `Bell`                  | ![bell-icon](https://vtexhelp.vtexassets.com/assets/docs/src/bell-icon___78c462f54a529a5b68f696ebb9256e47.png) |
    | `BellRinging`           | ![bell-ringing-icon](https://vtexhelp.vtexassets.com/assets/docs/src/bell-ringing-icon___ebaea6a1dfef58f1c76b14070703704b.png) |
    | `Checked`               | ![checked-icon](https://vtexhelp.vtexassets.com/assets/docs/src/checked-icon___c4dc5aa336fca566ec361125a9eb846e.png) |
    | `Info`                  | ![icon-info](https://vtexhelp.vtexassets.com/assets/docs/src/info-icon___f8c0cd591967892ec72328f277efa9d1.png) |
    | `Truck`                 | ![truck-icon](https://vtexhelp.vtexassets.com/assets/docs/src/truck-icon___ec3a7f0fcf2c02580d49444b71e8fc36.png)   |
    | `User`                  | ![user-icon](https://vtexhelp.vtexassets.com/assets/docs/src/user-icon___999dffa96120d0e51ead18263423ddad.png) |

- You want to allow Headless CMS editors to select in the Alert section from a wider range of icons supported by the `@faststore/ui` [iconography library](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/guides/faststore/reference-icons#usage).

## Implementation

### Overriding the Alert section

By leveraging `getOverriddenSection`, you can customize the Alert section's Headless CMS schema to offer additional icon options. Follow the steps below:

1. In the `src/components/sections` folder, create the folder `CustomIconsAlert` folder.
2. In the `CustomIconsAlert` folder, create the `CustomIconsAlert.tsx` file.
3. Import the following to the `CustomIconsAlert.tsx` file:

        ```tsx
        import { getOverriddenSection } from '@faststore/core'
        ```

4. Define the `CustomIconsAlert` component:

        ```tsx
        import { AlertSection, getOverriddenSection } from '@faststore/core'

        const CustomIconsAlert = getOverriddenSection({
        Section: AlertSection,
        })

        export default CustomIconsAlert
        ```

    - This is an Alert component override with custom icon options in the Headless CMS. The component is defined using `getOverriddenSection`.
    - This code changes only the schema to include more options for native Icons supported by `@faststore/ui`.
    - The override options specify:
      - **`Section`:** The section to be overridden (Alert).

    > ℹ️ For further details on code implementation, see the `CustomIconsAlert` folder available in the playground.store repository.

### Synchronizing the changes with the Headless CMS

Add the section to the Headless CMS by following the instructions available in [Sending components to the Headless CMS](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/guides/building-sections/overrides/sending-components-to-the-headless-cms). The following schema was used as an example:

        ```json
        {
        "name": "CustomIconsAlert",
        "schema": {
            "title": "Alert with more Icon options",
            "description": "Add an alert that has more Icon options",
            "type": "object",
            "required": ["icon", "content", "dismissible"],
            "properties": {
            "icon": {
                "type": "string",
                "title": "Icon",
                "enumNames": [
                "Bell",
                "BellRinging",
                "Checked",
                "Info",
                "Truck",
                "User",
                "Plus",
                "PlusCircle",
                "Ruler",
                "Star",
                "Storefront",
                "Twitter"
                ],
                "enum": [
                "Bell",
                "BellRinging",
                "Checked",
                "Info",
                "Truck",
                "User",
                "Plus",
                "PlusCircle",
                "Ruler",
                "Star",
                "Storefront",
                "Twitter"
                ]
            }
            }
        }
        }
        ```

## Results

Once you have [set your development mode](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/guides/building-sections/overrides/sending-components-to-the-headless-cms#previewing-changes-in-the-development-mode) to see the changes locally, you can see the new Alert icon. Below, you can check an example storefront before and after the instructions in this guide:

- **Before**

    The native Alert displays one of the default icons, the `BellRinging`, following the sentence `Get 15% off today: NEW15! Buy now`.

    ![before-custom-icon](https://vtexhelp.vtexassets.com/assets/docs/src/before-alert-icon___86e395e9cfc731f1f70b56cf3760af08.png)

- **After**
  
    The native Alert was replaced with the custom one, which brings a new icon, the `Star`, from the `@faststore/ui` iconography library, following the sentence `Rate your favorite item`.

    ![after-custom-icon](https://vtexhelp.vtexassets.com/assets/docs/src/after-custom-alert-icon___87cd248c0c406640aaaac4ef9238e101.png)
