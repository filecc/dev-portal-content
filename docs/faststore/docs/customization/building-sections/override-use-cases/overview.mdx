The Section override use cases provide an introduction, instructions for implementation, and results in the storefront, showing how we can implement section overrides. These examples can help you understand and leverage this feature.

| -------- | ----------- |
| [Adding more icons options to the Alert component](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/guides/faststore/override-use-cases-adding-more-icon-options-to-the-alert-component) | Create a dropdown in the Headless CMS, allowing editors to choose from a wider selection of icons supported by the `@faststore/ui` library.    |
