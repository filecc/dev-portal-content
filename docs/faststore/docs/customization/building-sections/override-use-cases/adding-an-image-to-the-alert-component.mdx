title: 'Adding an image to the Alert component'
---

This guide illustrates an advanced use case for [`getOverriddenSection`](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/guides/faststore/overrides-getoverriddensection-function) in FastStore. It focuses on customizing the Alert section's icon to display a custom image as an icon instead. 

> ℹ️ For detailed instructions on overriding components, refer to [Overriding native component’s props](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/guides/faststore/overrides-component-props) and [Overriding a native component](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/guides/faststore/overrides-native-component).

## Context

- The native Alert section provides an `icon` prop for customization. It only accepts pre-defined icons, but you want more control and flexibility over the displayed content.
- You want to display a custom image as the icon alongside the text in your alert messages.

## Implementation

By leveraging `getOverriddenSection`, you can create a custom component called `AlertWithImage` that achieves the desired functionality. Follow the steps below:

1. In the `src/components/sections` folder, create the folder `AlertWithImage` folder.
2. In the `AlertWithImage` folder, create the `AlertWithImage.tsx` file.
3. Import the following to the `AlertWithImage.tsx` file:

    ```tsx
    import { getOverriddenSection } from "@faststore/core";
    import Image from "next/image";
    import { useMemo } from "react";
    ```

4. Define the `AlertWithImageProps` interface:

    ```tsx focus=5:9
    import { getOverriddenSection } from "@faststore/core";
    import Image from "next/image";
    import { useMemo } from "react";

    interface AlertWithImageProps
        extends Omit<React.ComponentProps<typeof AlertSection>, "icon"> {
        src: string;
        alt: string;
    }
    ```

   - This interface defines the props accepted by the `AlertWithImage` component.
   - It inherits all props from the native Alert component, excluding the icon prop, which we intend to replace with an image.
   - It adds a new prop named `src`, which specifies the image source URL.

5. Create the `AlertWithImage` component:

    ```tsx focus=10:31
    import { useMemo } from "react";
    import { AlertSection, getOverriddenSection } from "@faststore/core";
    import { Image_unstable as Image } from "@faststore/core/experimental";

    interface AlertWithImageProps
        extends Omit<React.ComponentProps<typeof AlertSection>, "icon"> {
        src: string;
        alt: string;
    }

    export default function AlertWithImage(props: AlertWithImageProps) {
        const { src, alt, ...otherProps } = props;

        const OverriddenAlert = useMemo(
            () =>
            getOverriddenSection({
                Section: AlertSection,
                className: styles.alertWithImage,
                components: {
                    Icon: {
                        Component: () => (
                            <Image src={props.src} alt={props.alt} width={24} height={24} />
                        ),
                    },
                },
            }),
        []
    );

    return <OverriddenAlert {...otherProps} icon="" />;
    }
    ```

    - This function receives the `AlertWithImageProps`.
    - It destructures the `src` prop containing the image source and remaining props using the spread operator (`...otherProps`).
    - The core functionality lies within the `useMemo` hook.
      - It defines the `OverriddenAlert` constant using `getOverriddenSection`.
      - The override options specify:
        - **`Section`:** The section to be overridden (Alert).
        - **`components`:** An object containing the override for the Icon component.

    - Inside the Icon override:
      - **`Component`:** A function returning an `Image` component. This displays the image specified by the `src` prop.
      - **`width`** and **`height`:** Optional props to set the size of the image.

    - The use of `useMemo` ensures this override is only created once, improving performance.
    - The function returns the `OverriddenAlert` component, spreading the `otherProps` and setting the `icon` prop to `noop` (effectively disabling the default icon behavior).

    > ℹ️ For further details on code implementation, see the `AlertWithImage` folder available in the playground.store repository.

6. Add the section to the Headless CMS by following the instructions available for sending components to the Headless CMS.

The following schema was used as an example:

    ```json 
    [
        {
        "name": "AlertWithImage",
        "schema": {
        "title": "Alert with image",
        "description": "Add an Alert that has an Image as an icon",
        "type": "object",
        "required": ["src", "content", "dismissible"],
        "properties": {
            "src": {
            "type": "string",
            "title": "Image source",
            "description": "Source of the Alert icon image"
            },
            "content": { "type": "string", "title": "Content" },
            "link": {
            "title": "Link",
            "type": "object",
            "properties": {
                "text": { "type": "string", "title": "Link Text" },
                "to": { "type": "string", "title": "Action link" }
            }
            },
            "dismissible": {
            "type": "boolean",
            "default": false,
            "title": "Is dismissible?"
            }
          }
        }
      }
    ]
    ```

## Results

Once you have [set your development mode](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/guides/faststore/headless-cms-previewing-changes-in-development-mode) to see the changes locally, you can see the image as an icon in the alert:

- **Before**
  
  The native Alert displays one of the default icons, the `BellRinging`, following the sentence `Get 15% off today: NEW15! Buy now`.

- **After**
  
  The native Alert was replaced with the custom one, which features a pink image in the form of an icon added through Headless CMS.
