title: 'Dynamic Content'
---

Dynamic Content allows you to customize your home and landing pages with server-side data fetching using FastStore. This feature improves performance and SEO by dynamically displaying fetched data in store sections on these pages.

*This video guides you on creating a landing page in your Headless CMS and using Dynamic Content on it. In this example, we've already set up the dynamic content in the store code, including the page slug, `/my-landing-page`. The landing page features two Hero sections: a [native one](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/guides/faststore/organisms-hero) displaying an image added from the Headless CMS, and a custom one with a fixed image sourced directly from an API defined in the store code.*

> ℹ️ For other types of pages, such as collections (PLPs) and product pages (PDPs), server-side data fetching is already available via API Extensions. Refer to the [API Extension documentation](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/guides/faststore/api-extensions-overview) for more details on fetching data for these pages.

## Before you begin

<Steps>

### Update the `@faststore/core` package

To benefit from this feature,  your store `@faststore/core` package must have a version equal to or above  `v3.0.0`. Follow the steps below to update the package:

1. Update your store’s `@faststore/core` package to, for example, the `v3.0.0` by running the following command:

    ```bash
    yarn add @faststore/core@3.0.0
    ```

2. Run `yarn dev` to sync the changes to your project.

### Understand Section Override and API extensions

To work with dynamic content, you need knowledge of [Section Override](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/guides/faststore/overrides-overview) and [API extensions](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/guides/faststore/api-extensions-overview).
