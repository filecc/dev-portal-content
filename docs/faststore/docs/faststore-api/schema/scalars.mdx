## Scalars

### ActiveVariations

The `ActiveVariations` scalar type represents a combination of active product variations.

Example:

```json
{
  Color: 'Red', Size: '42'
}
```

### Boolean

The `Boolean` scalar type represents `true` or `false`.

### Float

The `Float` scalar type represents signed double-precision fractional values as specified by [IEEE 754](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IEEE_floating_point).

### FormattedVariants

The `FormattedVariants` scalar type represents a collection of product variations with additional details like image source, description, and values.

Example:

```json
{
  Color: [
    {
      src: "https://storecomponents.vtexassets.com/...",
      alt: "...",
      label: "...",
      value: "..."
    },
    {
      src: "https://storecomponents.vtexassets.com/...",
      alt: "...",
      label: "...",
      value: "..."
    }
  ],
  Size: [
    {
      src: "https://storecomponents.vtexassets.com/...",
      alt: "...",
      label: "...",
      value: "..."
    }
  ]
}
```

### ID

The `ID` scalar type represents a unique identifier, often used to refetch an object or as key for a cache. The ID type appears in a JSON response as a String; however, it is not intended to be human-readable. When expected as an input type, any string (such as `"4"`) or integer (such as `4`) input value will be accepted as an ID.

### Int

The `Int` scalar type represents non-fractional signed whole numeric values. Int can represent values between -(2^31) and 2^31 - 1.

### ObjectOrString

A string or the string representation of an object (a stringified object).

### SlugsMap

Example:

```json
{
  'Color-Red-Size-40': 'classic-shoes-37'
}
```

### String

The `String` scalar type represents textual data, represented as UTF-8 character sequences. The String type is most often used by GraphQL to represent free-form human-readable text.

### VariantsByName

The `VariantsByName` scalar type represents a collection of variations listed by their names, like a list of available `Color` options or `Size` options.

Example:

```json
{
  Color: [ "Red", "Blue", "Green" ],
  Size: [ "40", "41" ]
}
```
