If you need to update the [`@fastore/core`](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/guides/faststore/project-structure-overview#packagejson) package, follow the instructions below:

1. Open your FastStore code and navigate to the `package.json` file.

2. In `dependencies` > `@faststore/core`, change the version to the latest one. In the example above, we will use `^3.0.0`.

    ```json
    "@faststore/core": "^3.0.0",
    ```

3. Open the terminal and run `yarn` to update the version.
