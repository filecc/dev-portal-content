title: '3. FastStore CLI'
---

The FastStore Command Line Interface (CLI) is the main pre-configured tool for initializing, building, and developing FastStore projects.

Also, the CLI is responsible for keeping the stores up-to-date with the [`@faststore/core`](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/guides/faststore/project-structure-overview#faststorecore) package and enabling the cloud platform to understand the FastStore project.

## Running FastStore CLI on the project

The CLI is a dependency in the `package.json` file of the FastStore project, so once you run `yarn install` during the [set up of the project](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/guides/faststore/getting-started-2-setting-up-the-project) you can start using it on the project.

### Commands

#### `dev`

Starts the project in the development environment and usually servers it at `http://localhost:3000`. It allows you to make changes to the project and see the results in real-time locally on your machine without affecting the production environment.

```bash
yarn dev
```

#### `build`

Generates a store in the production environment by compiling the project and optimizing it for production usage.

```bash
yarn build
```

#### `start`

Executes a Next.js project in the root directory and usually servers it at `http://localhost:3000`.

```bash
yarn start
```

#### `cms-sync`

Sync changes within the `cms` folder of your FastStore project with the Headless CMS app.

```bash
yarn cms-sync
```
