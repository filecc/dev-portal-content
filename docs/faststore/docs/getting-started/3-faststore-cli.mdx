title: '3. FastStore CLI'
---

The FastStore Command Line Interface (CLI) provides pre-configured scripts for starting, building, and developing FastStore projects. It also helps keep FastStore projects up to date with the [`@faststore/core`](/docs/getting-started/3-project-structure#faststorecore) package.

## Running FastStore CLI on the project

The CLI is automatically added as a dependency in your project's `package.json` file, so once you run `yarn install` during the [project setup](/docs/getting-started/2-setting-up-the-project), you can start using it in the project.

## Installing FastStore CLI globally using `npm`

To use FastStore CLI commands globally on your machine, install the [`@faststore/cli`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@faststore/cli) using `npm`, and run the following command in the terminal:

```bash
  npm install -g @faststore/cli
```

## Default commands
Below is a brief description of the default commands available in the FastStore CLI. For detailed information about each command, click the respective command name.

> ⚠️ Running the commands through `yarn` is already enough to develop part of your store. However, to set up your project with Headless CMS and create new sections, you need to install the FastStore CLI and use its commands.

| [`build`](#build) | Generates a production-ready storefront.  It compiles the project and optimizes it for production usage. |

| [`dev`](#dev) | Starts the project in the development environment and uses`http://localhost:3000` as server by default. It allows you to make changes to the project and see the results locally on your machine in real time without affecting the production environment. |
| [`help`](#help) | Displays help for FastStore CLI commands. |
