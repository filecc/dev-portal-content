> ⚠️  You no longer need to use this documentation to activate your store's PWA notice. From now on follow the instructions available in [Enabling PWA push notifications in your store](https://help.vtex.com/en/tutorial/enabling-pwa-push-notifications-in-your-store--1be3ZPhbsgZSbE7h5H46pG).

All VTEX IO stores natively have a **PWA** at their disposal. A PWA is a sort of web app used to natively promote certain advantageous features to users, such as offline functionalities or a home screen icon.

This PWA can be made available for user installation in three distinct moments of their browsing experience: during the **first visit** on the store's site, when adding the **first item to the cart** or when completing the **first purchase**.

Find out how to configure the prompt in your store by following the steps below.

## Instructions

1. In the desired account's admin, access **CMS** and select the **Site Editor**.
2. Click on **Store**.
