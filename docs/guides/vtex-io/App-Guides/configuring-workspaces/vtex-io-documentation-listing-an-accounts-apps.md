Understanding the apps installed or linked to an account is pivotal for effective development and account management. The [VTEX IO CLI](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/guides/vtex-io-documentation-vtex-io-cli-installation-and-command-reference) simplifies this task by providing a straightforward command to access the list of apps associated with a specific account and workspace.

## Instructions

1. Open the terminal and log into the desired account using the [VTEX IO CLI](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/guides/vtex-io-documentation-vtex-io-cli-installation-and-command-reference). If applicable, switch to the desired [workspace](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/guides/vtex-io-documentation-workspace).
2. Run the following command:

    ```sh
    vtex list
    ```

Upon executing this command, the VTEX IO CLI will display a detailed list of installed and linked apps within the account. This list includes vital information such as app names and their respective versions.

**Example output:**

```terminal
$ vtex list
