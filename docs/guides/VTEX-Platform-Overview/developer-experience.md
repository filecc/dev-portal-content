## App development

[VTEX IO](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/guides/vtex-io-documentation-what-is-vtex-io) is our development platform that simplifies building, managing, and scaling ecommerce solutions by offering a comprehensive suite of tools and services,  manual coding efforts while ensuring performance, scalability, and security for your projects.

Within the VTEX IO platform, you can leverage familiar technologies and frameworks like [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/), [React](https://react.dev/), [GraphQL](https://graphql.org/), and [Node](https://nodejs.org/en) to enable rapid development and evolution. This set of technologies allows you to build custom web storefronts, customize the shopper experience, integrate with third-party systems, and create custom applications or other components to extend the VTEX IO’s functionalities.

Next, you will find an overview of the main capabilities of the VTEX IO platform.

### Developer tools

Learn about the essential developer tools, which equip you with the knowledge to streamline your app development journey with VTEX IO.

#### Command Line Interface (CLI)

A Command Line Interface (CLI) is a text-based interface used to interact with a computer system or software application by typing commands into a terminal or command prompt. It allows users to perform tasks such as running programs, managing files, and configuring settings efficiently.

To build and develop any project in the VTEX IO, use the pre-configured [**VTEX IO CLI**](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/guides/vtex-io-documentation-vtex-io-cli-installation-and-command-reference). This CLI is the starting and ending point for any development on the VTEX platform. It provides the ability to perform actions relevant to the development process, such as releasing new app versions, for example.

>ℹ️ For [FastStore](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/guides/faststore/docs-what-is-faststore) projects, we also offer the [**FastStore CLI**](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/guides/faststore/getting-started-3-faststore-cli). This CLI tool connects the source code in [`@faststore/core`](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/guides/faststore/project-structure-overview#packagejson) package with your customizations and extensions for your FastStore project.

#### Workspaces

[Workspaces](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/guides/vtex-io-documentation-workspace) are isolated environments for app development, acting as separate versions of the same account. There are three types of workspaces in VTEX:

- **Master**: A unique production workspace that reflects the live store content.
- [**Development workspaces**](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/guides/vtex-io-documentation-creating-a-development-workspace): Environments that allow testing changes in real time. They provide freedom in code development without affecting user traffic and the live store. Necessary when making changes to storefronts or developing a new VTEX IO app.
- [**Production workspaces**](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/guides/vtex-io-documentation-creating-a-production-workspace): Mainly used to validate VTEX IO apps. These workspaces handle traffic, so they can be used to run [A/B tests](#ab-tests) and can be [promoted to master](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/guides/vtex-io-documentation-promoting-a-workspace-to-master).

To learn how to manage workspaces effectively in your projects, check out the [Best practices on workspaces management](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/guides/vtex-io-documentation-workspaces-best-practices) guide.

#### A/B Tests

After [installing your app](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/guides/vtex-io-documentation-installing-an-app) in a [production workspace](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/guides/vtex-io-documentation-creating-a-production-workspace), it is possible to run an [A/B test](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/guides/vtex-io-documentation-running-native-ab-testing) to compare traffic and choose the workspace that performs better in terms of user engagement and conversions.

#### Builders

[Builders](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/guides/vtex-io-documentation-builders) streamline the development experience by abstracting complex implementation details, enabling developers to focus on enhancing stores’ capabilities. Acting as bridges, builders allow different parts of an app to work together by configuring and connecting to necessary services.

There are various [types of builders](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/guides/vtex-io-documentation-builders#list-of-builders), each equipped with pre-built functionalities and integration options, facilitating quick feature implementation for specific tasks or functionalities. For example, some builders focus on [developing new storefront apps](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/guides/vtex-io-documentation-react-builder), [setting styles for your components](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/guides/vtex-io-documentation-styles-builder) within your [Store Theme app](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/guides/vtex-io-documentation-3-settingyourstoretheme), [publishing app documentation](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/guides/vtex-io-documentation-docs-builder), among others.

By leveraging builders, developers can extend the functionality of the VTEX platform without starting from scratch. This modular approach promotes flexibility, scalability, and efficiency in developing and customizing VTEX-based ecommerce solutions, accelerating development cycles, promoting code reusability, and facilitating rapid [deployment](#deployment) of new functionalities.

#### Edition apps

[Edition apps](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/guides/vtex-io-documentation-edition-app) are collections of VTEX apps that define the functionalities available in a VTEX account. They consist of a bundle of settings, policies, backend, and frontend apps, aiming to streamline the setup and management of essential configurations quickly and efficiently.

We offer two native Edition Apps:

- **Edition Store**: For Store Framework stores.
- **Edition Business**: For Legacy CMS Portal stores.

>ℹ️ To learn how to develop your own Edition App, check out the [Developing an Edition App](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/guides/vtex-io-documentation-configuring-an-edition-app) guide.

### VTEX Apps

[VTEX Apps](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/guides/vtex-io-documentation-what-is-a-vtex-app) expand VTEX platform capabilities across various aspects of digital commerce, such as marketing, analytics, logistics, security, and store design.

We offer the following types of apps:

- [**Storefront apps**](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/guides/vtex-io-documentation-1-developing-storefront-apps-using-react-and-vtex-io): React components that enhance the functionality and user experience of your store, such as product carousels or navigation menus.
