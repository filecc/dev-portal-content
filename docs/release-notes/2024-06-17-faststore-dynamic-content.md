[Dynamic Content](LINK) is a new FastStore feature that allows you to customize your store home and landing pages using server-side data fetching. This means the content on these pages can be dynamically retrieved from the server, improving both performance and SEO.

## What changed?

Previously, this type of customization was only available for Product Listing (PLP) and Product Details Pages (PDP) through [API extensions](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/guides/faststore/api-extensions-overview).

Now, with Dynamic Content, you can leverage server-side data fetching to create a richer and more dynamic experience for your home and landing pages.

## Why did we make this change?

Dynamic Content can offer:

- **Improved performance**: Faster initial page load by fetching data on the server side.
- **Enhanced SEO**: Dynamically generated content is more easily indexed by search engines.
- **Greater flexibility**: Server-side data fetching allows for more customization of your home and landing pages.
- **Advanced data fetching**: Dynamic Content supports data fetching mechanisms like GraphQL queries, enabling flexible data retrieval from various APIs.

## What needs to be done?
