The FastStore WebOps app now provides direct access to build logs for each store deployment within the VTEX Admin. This enhancement helps you monitor the status of your deployments and quickly understand the success or failure of each build.

## What has changed?

Previously, build logs were only accessible through GitHub.

Now, build logs are also available directly within the WebOps page of  VTEX Admin. With build logs integrated alongside other store information, you gain a better understanding of the deployment's context, making it easier to share build logs with team members for faster troubleshooting and problem-solving.

## What needs to be done?

No action is required. The build logs feature is already available in the WebOps page of the Admin. For more information, see the [WebOps Dashboard documentation](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/guides/faststore/1-onboarding-dashboard#build-logs).
