After developing your store with [Store Framework](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/guides/store-framework) and [going live](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/guides/vtex-io-documentation-go-live), you may need to make some updates, such as adding new features to your [Store Theme](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/guides/vtex-io-documentation-store-theme) and extending your store’s functionalities to enhance the shopping experience or improve the ecommerce management.

In this section, you will find recommendations to help you successfully update your live store.

## Before you begin

<Steps>

### Develop a Store Theme

Ensure your store has a [Store Theme](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/guides/vtex-io-documentation-store-theme) developed with [VTEX IO](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/guides/vtex-io-documentation-what-is-vtex-io) and [Store Framework](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/guides/store-framework), following the [Storefront](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/guides/getting-started-3) guide.

### Check the builders

Check if the builders are properly installed in your Store Theme. To use builders, you must have at least the `vtex.builder-hub@0.293.4` version installed in your account. Also, you need to specify them in the app’s `manifest.json` file. Learn more at [Builders](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/guides/vtex-io-documentation-builders).

### Customize your theme

Customize your store theme according to your business needs, following the guides within the [Store Framework](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/guides/store-framework) section, such as [Building pages](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/guides/building-pages) and [Using components](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/guides/using-components) guides.

### Go live

After developing your store with VTEX IO and Store Framework, and customizing it according to your business needs, follow the instructions in [Going live with a new store](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/guides/vtex-io-documentation-go-live) to make your ecommerce available to shoppers.
